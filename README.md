- Node.js Backend Repo Link -> [Node.js Backend Link](https://github.com/komnatadeveloper/node_for_flutter_socket)



## Getting Started

- Go to [Node.js Backend Link](https://github.com/komnatadeveloper/node_for_flutter_socket) 
- Clone to your computer, open terminal and run
```
npm i
```
and then ->
```
npm run server
```

then learn your server/computer local ip (e.g.  http://192.168.1.45 or similar, )

then go to file lib/constants/constants.dart. Find -> apiUrl and update this variable as local ip **with your port number (3000)**. Now you have a basic chat Application with Node.js socket.io and Flutter Mobile Client
